# AGI Project README

## Overview

Welcome to the AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) Project! This open-source initiative aims to develop an advanced AGI system, designed to perform a wide array of cognitive tasks with human-like efficiency and adaptability. Our AGI combines state-of-the-art techniques in planning, prompt generation, tool invocation, and long-term memory management.

## Features

1. Planning: Our AGI system uses advanced planning algorithms to strategize and execute complex tasks efficiently.
2. Prompt Generation: The system generates contextually relevant prompts to interact and respond accurately across various scenarios.
3. Tools Catalog: A comprehensive catalog of tools that the AGI can invoke via function calls to perform specific tasks.
4. Long-Term Memory: An extensive knowledge base that allows the AGI to store, retrieve, and utilize information over extended periods.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x or higher
- npm 6.x or higher

### Quick start

1. Clone the Repository:
    

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AGI-Project.git
    cd AGI-Project
    

2. Install Dependencies:
    

    npm install
    

3. Set Up Environment Variables:
    Create a .env file in the root directory and configure the required environment variables:
    

    PORT=3000   
    REDIS_URI=redis://localhost:6379
    

### Running the AGI

1. Initialize the System:
    

    npm run initialize
    

2. Start the AGI:
    

    npm start
    

3. Interact with the AGI:
    Use the provided interface to input tasks and receive responses from the AGI.

## Project Structure

- /planning: Contains modules and scripts for the planning algorithms.
- /prompt_generation: Includes the logic and models for generating prompts.
- /tools_catalog: Houses the catalog of tools and the function calling mechanism.
- /long_term_memory: Manages the long-term memory and knowledge base.
- /tests: Test cases for different components of the AGI.
- /scripts: Utility scripts for setup and initialization.
- /config: Configuration files and environment settings.
